# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Rules of the Game:

Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
User wins on same choice

### Creation

I used prompts and alerts to create the layout for the game.

``` javascript
var choice = prompt("Choose your option:"+"\n"+"r = rock"+"\n"+"p = paper"+"\n"+"s = scissors");
```

It gets an input from the user through the browser and compares their choice to a randomly generated choice from the computer. There are 5 rounds and the score/outcome will be displayed at the end.
